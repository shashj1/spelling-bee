# 🐝 Spelling Bee!

A fun, bright spelling practice app for primary school children. Words are read aloud with silly sentences and a funny story, all using British English. Designed for a whole class — parents upload the weekly spelling list once, and every child can practise all week for free.

**Live app:** https://shashj1.github.io/spelling-bee

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple spelling groups** (e.g. PENS, etc.) — each group gets its own word list
- **Upload words** by typing them in or **photographing the spelling sheet** (uses AI vision)
- **Words read aloud** using high-quality text-to-speech (OpenAI TTS)
- **Funny British sentences** for each word (generated by Claude AI)
- **Adjustable pause timer** so children can write at their own pace
- **Letter-by-letter spelling check** at the end — tap to reveal & hear each word spelt out
- **Encouraging feedback** based on score (never competitive or ranking)
- **Silly story** using all the spelling words, read aloud
- **Practice tracker** — see which children have practised this week (just names & attempt counts, no scores)
- **Auto-resets every Thursday at noon UK time** for the new spelling week
- **All content generated once per week** — after that, zero API costs
- **Audio stored in Firebase** — no repeated TTS charges
- **Works on mobile and desktop** — responsive design
- **Fun splash screen with music** 🎵

## 🚀 Setup Guide (Step by Step)

### 1. Create a Firebase Project (free)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Click **"Create a project"** (or "Add project")
3. Name it something like `spelling-bee`
4. Disable Google Analytics (not needed) → **Create Project**

#### Enable Firestore Database:
1. In the Firebase console sidebar, click **"Firestore Database"**
2. Click **"Create database"**
3. Choose **"Start in test mode"** (we'll secure it later if needed)
4. Pick the closest region (e.g. `europe-west2` for UK) → **Enable**

#### Enable Firebase Storage:
1. In the sidebar, click **"Storage"**
2. Click **"Get started"**
3. Choose **"Start in test mode"** → **Next** → **Done**

#### Get Your Firebase Config:
1. In the sidebar, click the **⚙️ gear icon** → **"Project settings"**
2. Scroll down to **"Your apps"**
3. Click the **web icon** `</>` to add a web app
4. Name it `spelling-bee` → **Register app**
5. You'll see a config object like this — **copy it**:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "AIzaSy...",
  "authDomain": "spelling-bee-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
  "projectId": "spelling-bee-xxxxx",
  "storageBucket": "spelling-bee-xxxxx.firebasestorage.app",
  "messagingSenderId": "123456789",
  "appId": "1:123456789:web:abc123"
}
```

### 2. Get API Keys

#### Anthropic (Claude) API Key:
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Sign up / log in
3. Go to **API Keys** → **Create Key**
4. Add some credit (£5 will last years for this app)

#### OpenAI API Key:
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up / log in
3. Go to **API Keys** → **Create new secret key**
4. Add some credit (£5 will last years for this app)

### 3. Open the App & Configure

1. Go to **https://shashj1.github.io/spelling-bee**
2. You'll see the setup wizard (first time only):
   - **Step 1:** Enter your Anthropic and OpenAI API keys
   - **Step 2:** Set up your spelling groups (e.g. "PENS")
3. Done! Share the link with other parents — they won't need any keys or config.

### 4. Share with Other Parents

Send parents the link: **https://shashj1.github.io/spelling-bee**

That's it! The Firebase config is built into the app and API keys are stored in the cloud. Other parents just open the link and start using it.

## 📱 Weekly Workflow

### Thursday (after school):
1. A parent opens the app
2. Taps the spelling group that needs updating
3. Either **types the words** or **takes a photo** of the spelling sheet
4. The app generates funny sentences, a silly story, and all audio (~1 minute)
5. Done! All other parents and children now have access

### Thursday–Wednesday:
1. Child opens the app
2. Picks their spelling group
3. Sets their writing time with the slider
4. Listens to each word, writes it down
5. Checks their answers at the end
6. Enters their score → gets an encouraging message
7. Listens to the silly story
8. Picks their name → logged as "practised"

### Checking who's practised:
- Tap **"Who's practised?"** on the home screen
- Shows each child's name and how many times they've practised
- No scores shown — just encouragement!

## 🛠️ Development

### Run locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashj1/spelling-bee.git
cd spelling-bee
npm install
npm start
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages:
The app auto-deploys via GitHub Actions when you push to `main`. Or manually:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Project structure:
```
src/
├── App.js              # Main app with all page components
├── App.css             # Styles (fun, bright, child-friendly)
├── firebase.js         # Firebase configuration & data access
├── services/

│   └── audio.js        # Audio playback & browser TTS fallback
├── components/

│   └── SoundWave.js    # Audio playing indicator
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- API keys are stored in Firebase Firestore (not in the code)
- The Firebase config is public (this is normal — Firebase security rules protect the data)
- For production use, you should update your Firestore security rules to restrict access
- Browser `localStorage` only stores the Firebase config (no sensitive data)

### Recommended Firestore Rules:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

For stricter security, you could limit writes to specific collections.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"No words yet this week"** — A parent needs to upload the spelling list for that group.

**Audio not playing** — Make sure your device isn't on silent. On mobile, you may need to tap the screen first (browser autoplay policy).

**Photo not reading correctly** — Try taking the photo in good light with the words clearly visible. You can always edit the extracted words before generating.

**App looks wrong after Thursday** — The auto-reset happened! Upload the new week's words.
